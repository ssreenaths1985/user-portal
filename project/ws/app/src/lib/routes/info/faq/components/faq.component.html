                      <p>An official’s Workplace Competency Assessment Score (WPCAS) is constructed from their colleagues’ (peers, subordinates, and superiors) assessments about their performance. Through these assessments, an official’s colleagues are provided the opportunity to examine the extent to which he/she is demonstrating a particular competency in the workplace. For each competency an official is supposed to have, his/her colleagues receive questions where they are asked to indicate how he/she performed recently on that competency. The responses to these questions are then collated to create a single score for each competency every 3 months. 
                        The assessments also serve the purpose of providing feedback to help officials improve their performance.</p>
